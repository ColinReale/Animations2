    <h1 class="animate__animated animate__bounce">My trip to NYC!</h1>
    <h3 class="A">The Manhattan Bridge from Brooklyn</h3>
    <img class="animate__animated animate__wobble" src="Bridge.jpg" />
    <p>Walking from my apartment in Brooklyn over this bridge into Manhattan would take me about an hour</p>
    <h3 class="B">Meeting Andrew Yang!</h3>
    <img class="animate__animated animate__headShake" src="Yang.jpg" />
    <p>I got to meet Andrew Yang! You can see how excited I was. I don't know that I agree with all of his policies but I think he's one of the most authentic people in politics. We need more people like him.</p>
    <h3 class="C">Enjoying a nice evening</h3>
    <img class="animate__animated animate__flash" src="Walk.jpg" />
    <p>I don't take lots of photos but this was somehow a very serene and dare I say transcendent evening, and I wanted to remember it.</p>
    <h3 class="D">My new boots!</h3>
    <img class="animate__animated animate__flip" src="boots.jpg" />
    <p>Tell me these aren't sick.</p>
    <p>It's important to find joy in the little things.</p>
    <h3 class="animate__animated animate__lightSpeedInRight">Catching up with an old friend</3>
        <br>

    <p>I was able to meet up with an old roommate from college named Kenny. I hadn't seen him since 2015!</p>
